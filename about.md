Who am I? Thanks for asking

My name is John Thurman - I am a Data Scientist based in Vancouver, Canada. I have experience working with a range of 
tools and data sets in the UK and Canada. A few choice examples below:
 * **Monte Carlo analysis** - Completing statistical analysis of large Defined Benefit pension plans to identify 
 alternative investments strategies and monitor risk.
 * **Image recognition** - A project I worked on whilst completing my Data Science diploma involved detecting fruit 
 in images. I built and trained a CNN built in Tensorflow and Keras (Python), using data collected from Flickr.
 * **Longevity Analysis** - I worked with companies to determine how to use historic mortality information to project 
 future mortality rates. My clients used these to help understand the provisions they needed to set aside for the Pension Plan members


### More Information

* **Masters in Mathematics (University of Bristol, UK):** Areas of study included Bayesian statistics, Information Theory and Quantum Mechanics</li>
* **Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, UK:** An Actuary is a regulated professional who typically works
 in Insurance, Data analytics or supports Defined Benefit Pension plans - although the areas that Actuaries work continues to expand.
* **Post graduate diploma in Data Science at Brainstation, Vancouver, Canada** This course covered a wide range of modelling and
analytical techniques and tools with a focus on Python and libraries, and machine learning techniques.
