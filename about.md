I am Data Scientist based in Vancouver, Canada.

### More Information

I have background in maths and statistics - I completed a Masters in Mathematics at the University of Bristol, UK, I have become a Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, UK and have more recently gained a post-graduate diploma in Data Science from 
Brainstation, Vancouver, Canada.
