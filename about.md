I am Data Scientist based in Vancouver, Canada, with experience working in risk management and invesment consulting.

### More Information

I have a background in maths and statistics.  
<ul>
	<li>I have a Masters in Mathematics from the University of Bristol, UK. I studied a range of subjects including Bayesian statistics, Information Theory and Quantum Mechanics</li>
	<li>I am a Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, UK. For those who do not know, an Actuary is a regulated professional typically related to the Insurance, Data analytics and Defined Benefit Pension plans. Actuaries study elements of 
economics, finance, statistics and modelling. </li>
	<li>More recently, I have completed a post-graduate diploma in Data Science at Brainstation, Vancouver, Canada. The course covered a number of subjects including coding/ scripting in Python, Machine Learning and Statistical inference.</li>

I have 10 years of experience working as an Actuarial Consultant, providing investment management, risk management and actuarial services to some of the largest pensions plans across the UK and Canada. I am now currently looking for opportunities to leave pension 
plans behind me and use statistical techniques and machine learning to solve a wider range of business problems.
